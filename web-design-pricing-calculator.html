        <h2 class="information-heading">Here's some information you should know:</h2>
        <h3>Average cost of a <em>simple</em> website (US)</h3>
        <p>
          A simple website would be a website that has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page">dynamic content</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put simply these types of webpages are static and don't change very often. They lack input fields, user accounts, and submitable areas.
        </p>
        <em>Average Simple Website Cost: </em><strong>$1,000 &dash; $5,000</strong>

        <h3>Average cost of an <em>advanced</em> website (US)</h3>
        <p>
          While not thematically or presentationally much different from a simple website a more advanced website would have a dynamic content that will need to be updated and attended to.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a more complex website there will be input fields, newsletter subscriptions, quote calculators, dynamic content copy content, blogs/articles, and/or a tie-in with a content management system of some sort. While these don't look or feel much more difficult than a simple site there tends to be a significant amount of behind the scenes work going on.
        </p>
        <em>Average Advanced Website Cost: </em><strong>$3,000 &dash; $10,000</strong>

        <h3>Average cost of an <em>eCommerce</em> website (US)</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          eCommerce sites can be significantly more complex than a standard website. Depending on the needs of the business there tends to always be a need for a backend database. Including the ability to search through a range of items there also needs to be an ability to purchase those items. While there has been great leaps forward in recent years with digital payment processing it is important to know that there needs to always be extra attention taken to security which requires a higher level of time allocation to certain tasks. Additionally, there is often a need for creating user accounts which also adds a level of complexity when it comes to website and user security. These more advanced features require a significant amount of work and testing.
        </p>
        <em>Average eCommerce Website Cost: </em><strong>$6,000 &dash; $20,000+</strong>

        <h3>Average cost of a <em>web application</em> (US)</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          Web applications require a higher level of developer someone who is competent at with both frontend technologies as well as backend technologies. The scope of project tend to be large and time consuming, month &dash; years in time frame. These require high attention to detail, security, and advanced levels of testing.

        </p>
        <em>Average Web Application Cost: </em><strong>$10,000 &dash; $50,000+</strong>

        <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
